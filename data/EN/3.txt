The term "Great Britain" conventionally refers to the island of Great Britain, or politically to England, Scotland and Wales in combination.[52][53][54] However, it is sometimes used as a loose synonym for the United Kingdom as a whole.[55]

The term "Britain" is used both as a synonym for Great Britain,[56][57][58] and as a synonym for the United Kingdom.[59][58] Usage is mixed, with the BBC preferring to use Britain as shorthand only for Great Britain[60] and the UK Government, while accepting that both terms refer to the United Kingdom, preferring to use the term UK rather than Britain.[61] The UK Permanent Committee on Geographical Names lists "United Kingdom" and "UK or U.K." as shortened and abbreviated geopolitical terms for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, it does not list "Britain",[62] stating that it has been used "informally" by government websites.[63]

The adjective "British" is commonly used to refer to matters relating to the United Kingdom. The term has no definite legal connotation, but is used in law to refer to United Kingdom citizenship and matters to do with nationality.[64] People of the United Kingdom use a number of different terms to describe their national identity and may identify themselves as being British, English, Scottish, Welsh, Northern Irish, or Irish;[65] or as belonging to a combination of different national identities.
